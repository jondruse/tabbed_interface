TabbedInterface
===============

Build a tabbed interface very easily.  Requires Prototype.


Example
=======

In this simple example we setup a TabbedInterface with two tabs to show a list of Users and Admins.

<% tabbed_content do |box| %>
  
  <% box.tab("Users", users_path) %>
  <% box.tab("Admins", admins_path) %>
  
  # Put your default content here (content for the the first tab)
  <% box.content = capture do %>
    <%= render(:partial => "users/list") %>
  <% end %>

<% end %>


The tabbed_content helper yields an object that has two simple methods.

The 'tab' method.  

This method will setup a new tab header.  Just pass the title and the url to call and update the main content area.

the 'content' method.

The only requirement is that you use capture (as shown above).  This sets the default content for the interface. Then when you click
on a different tab, the content will be updated. You can put anything in here, but it will probably be a partial, being that the links
use link_to_remote to update the main content area.  There are no limitations on how many tabs you can have, or how many interfaces 
you can have on a page.

Enjoy!
